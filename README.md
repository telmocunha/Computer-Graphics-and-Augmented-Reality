# Computer-Graphics-and-Augmented-Reality
The project undertaken is part of the course “Computer Graphics and Augmented Reality”. This project is divided into three assignments with the aim of implementing and developing several methodologies studied during the course.

## First Assignment

The first assignment aims to implement several basic shapes (cubes, cylinders, spheres, etc) through different methods. Furthermore, using these techniques, a car racing scenario is created. The scenario features an interactive function. With the use of the following keys, it is possible to move within the scenario:
- “a”-rotated to the right;
-  “s”-rotated to the left;
-  “p”-move forward;
-  “l”-move backward;
-  “c”-toggle the camera to the car driver point.

The methods to perform the basic shapes and more advanced shapes are as follows: Revolution solids, Extrusion Solids and Compound Shapes.

## Second Assignment

The second assignment consist of adding textures to the all the elements implemented in the first assignment. Furthermore, attempts are made to add light into the objects. Lastly, a screen is added to the scenario that shows the live view captured from a camera onboard of one of the cars.

## Third Assignment
This final assignment is divided into two parts: the first part consists of modifying the scenario to be viewable in Stereo Visualization, and the second part consists of developing an Augmented Reality application. For this, the webcam is used to process each image with a marker. By detecting the marker, a basic shape with texture is displayed, and it can move along the display. The coordinates of the basic object are displayed at the same time, which is developed using the POSIT algorithm.
